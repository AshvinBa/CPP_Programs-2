/*
Make Palindrome.

You are given an array of strings arr of size n. You have to find out if it is possible to make a palindromic string by concatenating the strings in any order. Provided that all the strings given in the array are of equal length.

Example 1:
Input:
n = 4
arr = {"djfh", "gadt", "hfjd", "tdag"}
Output:
