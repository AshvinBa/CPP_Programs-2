/*
Exit Point in a Matrix

Given a matrix of size n x m with 0’s and 1’s, you enter the matrix at cell (0,0) in left to right direction. Whenever you encounter a 0 you retain it in the same direction, else if you encounter a 1 you have to change the direction to the right of the current direction and change that 1 value to 0, you have to find out from which index you will leave the matrix at the end.

Example 1:
Input: 
n = 3, m = 3
matrix = {{0, 1, 0},
          {0, 1, 1}, 
          {0, 0, 0}}
Output: 
{1, 0}
Explanation: 
Enter the matrix at (0, 0) 
-> then move towards (0, 1) ->  1 is encountered 
-> turn right towards (1, 1)  -> again 1 is encountered 
-> turn right again towards (1, 0) 
-> now, the boundary of matrix will be crossed ->hence, exit point reached at 1, 0..

Example 2:
Input: 
n = 1, m = 2
matrix = {{0, 0}}
Output: 
{0, 1}
Explanation: 
Enter the matrix at cell (0, 0).
Since the cell contains a 0, we continue moving in the same direction.
We reach cell (0, 1), which also contains a 0. So, we continue moving in the same direction, we exit the matrix from cell (0, 1).
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function FindExitPoint() which takes the matrix as an input parameter and returns a list containing the exit point.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n = number of rows and m = number of columns.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 100
